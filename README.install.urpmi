The Smolt hardware collector will not send any data until you do
so manually.

To send your hardware profile to http://smolts.org, run the
smoltSendProfile command. If you have installed the smolt-gui package,
you can also start Smolt from the applications menu in Tools -
System Tools.

If you want to update your hardware profile automatically on a monthly
basis, edit the file /etc/sysconfig/smolt and set
ENABLE_MONTHLY_UPDATE=1
